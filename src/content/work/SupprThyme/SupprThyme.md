## About SupprThyme

> "Good food and a warm kitchen are what make a house a home." - Rachael Ray

SupprThyme is a mobile app that takes the headache out of group dining decisions. Each person creates a profile stating their food preferences and dietary restrictions. Then SupprThyme suggests restaurants that cater to the whole group's collective needs.

### How It Works

Users create profiles with their food preferences and dietary restrictions. SupprThyme then scans the area and proposes restaurant options that could work for the group based on their criteria.

### Technologies Used

SupprThyme is built with modern technologies. The front-end is built with React, the back-end uses Node.js and Express, and PostgreSQL is used for the database. It also uses the Google Maps Platform for location services and the Restaurants API for menu and cuisine data.

### Challenges and Future Plans

The biggest challenge was developing the algorithm that intelligently weighs and prioritizes all the different preferences into one consensus restaurant pick. But the logic ensures everyone's voice and dietary needs get properly accounted for. No more feeling left out or having to settle.

Future updates will include the implementation of group voting, and group management.

So that's SupprThyme in a nutshell - the easier way for friend groups to agree on where to eat and hang out.
