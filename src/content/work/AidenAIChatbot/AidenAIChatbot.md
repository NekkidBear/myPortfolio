## Aidan: The Interactive AI Avatar - A Symphony of Python, Blender, and GPT

Embark on a unique coding and artistic journey as we breathe life into Aidan, an interactive AI avatar. This project is a testament to the fusion of creativity and technology, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

Our mission: To create a conversational character that transcends the traditional chatbot experience. Aidan, crafted with meticulous 3D modeling and powered by Chat GPT, interacts with users in a remarkably human-like manner. He listens to user audio, transforms it into text, and uses this text to generate GPT-driven responses. These responses are then converted back into audio and paired with synchronized animation, creating the illusion of a living, breathing character.

Aidan's 3D model, sculpted in Nomad and rigged for animation in Blender, is a sight to behold. With the power of OpenAI's GPT engine and a suite of other packages, Aidan is more than just a character - he's an interactive experience.
